Woodcoin a la "therealbitcoin" 

This is a retro version of Woodcoin.  Command line only.
  
Also builds statically with toolchain as described in therealbitcoin and related
documentation (good luck!).  

This is a hardened war-ready version of bitcoin for post-apocalypse 
and heavy battlefield use. 

Obviously github is not expected to be around nor trusted in such scenarios.  
Therefore it is suggested to keep a copy of this thing in local rad-hard storage.
