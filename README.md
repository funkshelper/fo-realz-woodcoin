# fo-realz-woodcoin
Woodcoin a la "therealbitcoin" 

This is a retro version of Woodcoin.  Command line only.
  
Also builds statically with toolchain as described in therealbitcoin and related
documentation (good luck!).  

This is a hardened war-ready full node and wallet for woodcoin, for post-apocalypse 
and heavy battlefield use.  Also can be used as reference implementation due to minimal external libraries. 

Obviously github is not expected to be around nor trusted in such scenarios.  
Therefore it is suggested to keep a copy of this thing in local rad-hard storage.
