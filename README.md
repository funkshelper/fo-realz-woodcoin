# fo-realz-woodcoin

...A funkenstein_the_dwarf production...

Woodcoin a la "therealbitcoin".   

This is a retro version of Woodcoin.  Command line only.  
It syncs far slower than more common wallet versions.  

This thing also builds statically with buildroot/musl toolchain as described 
in therealbitcoin and related documentation.  

This is a hardened war-ready full node and wallet for woodcoin, 
for post-apocalypse and heavy battlefield use.  
Also can be used as reference implementation due to minimal external libraries. 

Obviously github is not expected to be around nor trusted in such scenarios 
as those when this version becomes crucial to the network.
  
Therefore it is suggested to keep a copy of this thing in local rad-hard storage, 
and to use the tarballed src directory (verify the signature).
